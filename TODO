* Add a terminal size check (for example, require at least 80x24) to prevent
  crashes when the window is too small.

* Add tests for core modules. Skip TUI.

  Reason: curses-based TUI depends on real terminal behavior and input, making
  automated testing unreliable; it's normally tested manually.

* Consider whether checking TERMINAL or blocking non-XFCE terminals is worth it
  (likely no).
